# AdParlor API

AdParlor provides two sets of tools to access data from our stats APIs.
- These api sample files in Ruby, Python, and PHP
- A query generator is provided at https://app.adparlor.com

Getting Started

  - Log in to https://app.adparlor.com
  - Navigate to Analytics -> Data Reports
  - Build a custom report with the groupings and metrics you'd like to receive in your API results
  - Instead of clicking "Generate", click the menu arrow beside it and click "Generate API Call"

Notes
  - More documentation is coming soon
